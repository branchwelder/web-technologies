          <b>I like to creep around my home and act like a goblin.</b>
          I don't know why but I just enjoy doing this. Maybe it's my way of
          dealing with stress or something but I just do it about once every
          week. Generally I'll carry around a sack and creep around in a sort of
          crouch-walking position making goblin noises, then I'll walk around my
          house and pick up various different “trinkets” and put them in my bag
          while saying stuff like “I'll be having that” and laughing maniacally
          in my goblin voice (“trinkets” can include anything from stuff I find
          on the ground to cutlery or other utensils). The other day I was
          talking with my neighbours and they mentioned hearing weird noises
          like what I wrote about and I was just internally screaming the entire
          conversation. I'm 99% sure they don't know it's me but god that 1%
          chance is seriously weighing on my mind.
