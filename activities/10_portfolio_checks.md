# Checking your portfolio

Let's check the compatibility of your portfolio sites. The
[final portfolio assignment](/assignments/portfolio.md) has a number of
requirements that you will need to meet for your final submission. See the
assignment for details. Today, let's check your site navigation and
browser/mobile compatibility.

Add a link to your portfolio in
[the spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10H_dDWgXRlT_YO45uZy9vwmICFDfal3P1pd7ZQqp980/edit?usp=sharing).
Pair up with someone in class. **Create a shared Google doc to document your
findings.** Find their portfolio site link in the spreadsheet and do the
following tasks:

## Check content and navigation

From your partner's home page, navigate to all of the required content pages:

- Home page
- Bio/About page
- Cheatsheets page
- Four Mini-project writeups (MP0: Setup, MP1: Extension, MP2: Creative Code,
  MP3: Game)
- The MP2 sketch gallery
- All of the sketches from MP2, each on its own page
- The MP3 Game
- The final project proposal (the rest of the final project will of course not
  be up yet)

Ensure that all of the links work and that there is a clear path to each page.
It is ok if they aren't linked directly from the home page. For example, there
could be a subpage called "438 projects" or "web dev projects" that contains
links to the project pages. However, it should still be easy to find all of this
content.

Document any broken links and missing/hidden pages.

## Check another browser

Open their site in a different browser than the one you're currently using. It
would be best to try one each of Chrome, Firefox, and Safari. _Note: Edge is a
Chromium-based browser so you can be reasonably confident that a site that works
on Chrome will work on Edge_

Navigate around their site again. Do you notice anything that is different? Keep
an eye out for:

- images or gifs not displaying correctly
- transitions that don't work as expected
- incorrect/broken styling (particularly w.r.t sizing or display)

## Resize the browser window

Drag in the side of your browser window so the page is very narrow. How does the
site look now? Keep an eye out for:

- Overflows, pictures flowing off the screen
- Wonky percentage-based positioning or sizing
- No padding around text content (meaning text hits the edge of the screen)

## Check mobile

On your phone, open your partner's site in your mobile browser. **This is where
many of you will need to focus your efforts.** Navigate around the site again,
documenting places where the layout or styling may need to be adjusted.

## Come back together

Share your list of findings with each other. What common issues do you both need
to fix? How can you fix them?

## Polishing your site

See the in-class activities on [CSS Layouts](03_css_layouts.md),
[Accessibility](04_accessibility.md), and [Templates](07_templates.md) for more
