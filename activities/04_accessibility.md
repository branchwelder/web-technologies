# Accessibility on the web

Now, let's see how your portfolio site is doing in terms of accessibility.
Consider the
[Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-WCAG20-20081211/),
which specify that your sice should be perceivable, operable, understandable,
and robust.

- Do you include alt text and link text?
- Do you have appropriate contrast between foreground and background content?
  You can put your foreground and background colors into a contrast checker such
  as [coolors](https://coolors.co/contrast-checker/112a46-acc8e5)
- Do you rely on color to convey meaning?
- Can you use tab and enter to navigate your site?
- Does a user of your site know where they are and how to get back to home at
  all times?
- Do you ever hide focus styling? You can change it but a focus indicator should
  always be present
- Do you rely on color to convey meaning?
- How does your site render on desktop and mobile?
- Can you navigate your site with a screen reader?
- Does it work across different browsers?

You can use the guidelines listed
[here](https://www.w3.org/WAI/test-evaluate/preliminary/) to check your site's
accessibility.
