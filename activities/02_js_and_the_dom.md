# Introducing JavaScript

As usual, consult the class
[resource page on JavaScript](/resources/javascript.md) and post any helpful
overviews, tutorials, or videos you find in the Discord.

## Activity

The slides included a number of codepens that provide simple examples of DOM
interactions:

- [Adding an event listener](https://codepen.io/branchwelder/pen/abjJNmw)
- [Appending children to a bookmarks div](https://codepen.io/branchwelder/pen/oNMZbrG)
- [Querying the DOM and randomizing colors](https://codepen.io/branchwelder/pen/vYayyOP)
- [Setting and clearing text](https://codepen.io/branchwelder/pen/poZeeVm)

Start by playing around with them and modifying the code.

Once you have a handle on what's going on, add some JavaScript to your portfolio
page. Here are some ideas for what you could do:

- add a button that changes between light mode and dark mode
- Add
