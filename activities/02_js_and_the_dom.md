# Introducing JavaScript

As usual, consult the class
[resource page on JavaScript](/resources/javascript.md) and post any helpful
overviews, tutorials, or videos you find in the Discord.

- Read MDN's
  [Intro to JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript)
- [Introduction to the DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction)

## Activity

The slides included a number of codepens that provide simple examples of DOM
interactions:

- [Adding different kinds of event listeners](https://codepen.io/branchwelder/pen/abjJNmw)
- [Creating and adding elements](https://codepen.io/branchwelder/pen/oNMZbrG)
- [Querying the DOM and randomizing colors](https://codepen.io/branchwelder/pen/vYayyOP)

Start by playing around with them and modifying the code.

Once you have a handle on what's going on, add some JavaScript to your portfolio
page. Here are some ideas for what you could do:

- add a button that changes between light mode and dark mode
- Add
