# CSS Layouts

This activity is intended to help you practice CSS layout tools, namely flexbox
and grid. For MP2, you are required to submit a gallery page of your P5
sketches. You can easily build a responsive gallery page with CSS!

1. Explore the
   [example repository](https://github.com/branchwelder/portfolio-skeleton). It
   has small demonstrations of the core features of flexbox and grid. You can
   view a live site [here](https://twigg.gg/portfolio-skeleton/).
2. Use the examples and the resources below to prototype a gallery page for you
   P5.js sketches. The examples show how you can create a grid layout - but your
   gallery page should (eventually) include screenshots or gifs of your P5
   sketches.

I recommend making the outer container of your page a flex box and then putting
a div with `display:grid` inside it, as that will allow you to center the grid.
This is how the examples are structured, however, your grid elements should
include images inside them!

For now, you can use a placeholder image as you build your prototype. The
example repository also shows how you can put your P5 sketches into a single
HTML file and link to them from a different page. Your gallery should eventually
resemble something like [this](https://p5-demos.glitch.me/) or
[this](https://tone-demos.glitch.me/) gallery from Matt DesLaurier.
