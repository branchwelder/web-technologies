# MP0 - Portfolio page

For MP0, you will build a portfolio page and host it on Github pages.

**Initial submission deadline:** Tuesday, 10 January, before class. Submit a
link to your site via the Canvas assignment.

## Submission Requirements

These are the requirements for your portfolio site. Read them carefully!

- **_Hosted on Github pages._** I expect to be able to click the URL you submit
  in Canvas and be taken to your portfolio site.
- **_Includes your own custom styles._** Does it have to be pretty? No. Can it
  be simple? Yes. Does it have to be yours? Absolutely. At a minumum:
  - Non-default fonts and colors
  - Some basic positioning (e.g. centering)
- **_Includes (at least) one CSS transition._** The way you implement this is up
  to you, but you should look over the list of CSS properties and explore ones
  that seem interesting to you. For example, you could make your home page title
  change color, grow larger, and jiggle when someone moves their mouse cursor
  over it.
- **_Includes the following sub-pages:_**
  - **_An "about me" page with a short bio and picture._** If you have concerns
    about putting up public information about yourself on the internet, you are
    free to use pseudonymous information (e.g. a cartoon avatar, internet
    handle, fake bio). I just want to give you the option to make this your real
    portfolio site if you wish.
  - **_A bare-bones "cheatsheets" page._** You will be expected to add to this
    page throughout the quarter. This is primarily **for your own reference**,
    but I expect to see it grow over the quarter. You can start by creating a
    "CSS" section and copying in the snippet of CSS you used to make your CSS
    transition.
  - **_The MP0 Writeup._** A page reflecting on your process building this site.
    You should include the following sections:
    - **Overview**: A step-by-step overview of your process, with at least one
      screenshot of an unfinished site
    - **Issue**: Describe an issue you encountered and how you resolved it. For
      example, you might have had trouble pushing your site to Github, or a
      confusing syntax issue with HTML.
    - **CSS Transition**: A description of the CSS transition you implemented,
      why you chose it, and how you made it work, with a gif of it in action
    - **Ideas and Future**: Bullet points describing additional ideas and
      features you might like to add to your site in the future

### Optional additions

- Purchase and connect a custom domain!
- Add additional sub-pages for prior projects you have done!
- Make it look **really** nice! More CSS beyond the basics.
- Make it mobile-friendly!

## Instructions

### Create a repository

Head over to GitHub and create a new public repository named username.github.io,
where username is your GitHub username. This should create an empty repository.

### Clone it!

In VSCode, hit `Control/Command-Shift-P` to open the command palette. Start
typing Git:Clone. The autocomplete option should show up quickly, use the arrow
keys to navigate to it and hit enter. Select `Clone from GitHub`. Your available
repositories should show up; you might need to sign in with your Github
credentials. Select the repository you just created and choose a location on
your computer to clone it to. Open the folder in VSCode once it is there.

### Add some code

Copy the contents of the example site in this folder into the repository you
just cloned. Assuming you have installed the VSCode Live Server extension, right
click on `index.html` in the explorer side bar and click "Open with Live
Server". The page should open automatically in your browser. You can now edit
your site code and your changes will immediately be reflected in the browser -
no need to restart the server.

### Commit and push

Make some changes if you wish. Open the "Source control" panel lin the left
sidebar. There will be a list of changes you have made. Hover over the "Changes"
header, and you should see a Plus icon (+) appear to the right. Click it to
stage your changes. Enter a commit message (e.g. "Testing my portfolio site) in
the text entry box above (which should say "message"), and click the "Commit"
button. It should turn into a button that says "sync changes" - click it. This
will push your work to Github. Assuming you are successful, you should see your
site online at username.github.io in a few minutes!
