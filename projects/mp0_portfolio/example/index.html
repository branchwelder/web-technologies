      I like to creep around my home and act like a goblin.
    </h1>

    <p class="intro-paragraph">
      I don't know why but I just enjoy doing this. Maybe it's my way of dealing
      with stress or something but I just do it about once every week. Generally
      I'll carry around a sack and creep around in a sort of crouch-walking
      position making goblin noises, then I'll walk around my house and pick up
      various different “trinkets” and put them in my bag while saying stuff
      like “I'll be having that” and laughing maniacally in my goblin voice
      (“trinkets” can include anything from stuff I find on the ground to
      cutlery or other utensils). The other day I was talking with my neighbours
      and they mentioned hearing weird noises like what I wrote about and I was
      just internally screaming the entire conversation. I'm 99% sure they don't
      know it's me but god that 1% chance is seriously weighing on my mind.
