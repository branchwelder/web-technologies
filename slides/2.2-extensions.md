# Extensions!

## Anatomy of an extension

- `manifest.json` - _required_
- Toolbar icon
- Service worker - the extension's event handler
- UI elements
- Content script - inject logic into the page
- Options page - enables customization of the extension

### `manifest.json`

Required file that provides important information about the extension

```json
{
  // Required
  "manifest_version": 3,
  "name": "My Extension",
  "version": "1.0.1",

  // Recommended
  "action": {...},
  "default_locale": "en",
  "description": "A plain text description",
  "icons": {...},

  // everything else optional
}
```

### Toolbar icon

### UI elements

- An action click event.
- A popup.
- A context menu.
- An omnibox.
- A keyboard shortcut.
- Desktop notifications.
- Text-to-speech.
- A custom UI injected into a page.

### Content Scripts

- read and modify the content of a page
- live in an isolated world
- can be injected only on certain urls

### Options page

## Arrow Functions

```js
let hypot = (x, y) => {
  return Math.sqrt(x ** 2 + y ** 2);
};
```

## Iteration: classic

```js
// Low-level, more verbose
for (let i = 0; i < mondayLectures.length; i++) {
  const lecture = mondayLectures[i];
  lecture.textContent = "I hate Mondays 😫";
}
```

## Iteration: for...in

```js
// Iterate over object properties
for (const i in mondayLectures) {
  const lecture = mondayLectures[i];
  lecture.textContent = "I hate Mondays 😫";
}
```

## Iteration: for...of

```js
// Iterate over items
for (const lecture of mondayLectures) {
  lecture.textContent = "I hate Mondays 😫";
}
```

Map, Reduce, Filter Common patterns for transforming a collection of items en
masse

map: transform items 👨 👨 👧 ➡ 👨🏼 👨🏼 👧🏼 filter: choose some of the items 👨 👨
👧 ➡ 👨 👧 reduce: combine items 👨 👨 👧 ➡ 👨‍👨‍👧

## Scoping

```js
if (true) {
  let x = 1;
}

console.log(x);
```

. . .

What do you think will happen?

## Scoping

`let` and `const` are block-scoped

. . .

In other words, they are only visible within the curly braces `{}` they are
declared in.

## Scoping

```js
if (true) {
  let x = 1;
  log();
}

function log() {
  console.log(x);
}
```

. . .

What do you think will happen?

## Scoping

JavaScript uses _lexical scope_

. . .

Scope is determined by syntax, not execution

## You will also see var

```js
// var has different scoping behavior, which can be confusing

var index = 5;

// It is better to use let, but older snippets of code will use var
```
