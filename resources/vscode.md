# A List of VS Code Extensions

There are endless possibilities for customizing VSCode. Here are some of the
extensions I have installed! As a general rule, it's good to understand what an
extension does before you install it. They all have _some_ documentation in the
extension marketplace, which you should read before installation. If an
extension is causing issues, you can disable it or uninstall it. It's also good
to uninstall any extensions you're not using, otherwise they will continue to
run in the background.

## Essentials

- Live Server: _Local development server inside VSCode_
- Prettier: _Code formatting for a bunch of web-related languages_
- ESLint: _A linter for javascript_

## Nice-to-have

- Code Spell Checker: _A spell checker that also works for camelCase_
- Path Intellisense - _Autocompletes filenames (useful for importing things)_
- Path Autocomplete - _autocompletes paths (also useful for importing things)_
- IntelliSense for CSS class names in HTML: _adds autocompletion for your css
  class names_
- Markdown All In One: _keyboard shortcuts, auto preview, formatting, etc. for
  markdown_
- npm: _npm support (we will cover npm later)_
- npm intellisense: _adds autocompletion for npm modules_
- search node modules: _lets you search your gigantic node modules directory_
- visual studio intellicode: _AI autocompletion and suggestions, works WAY
  better than I thought it would_
- Auto close tag: _automatically closes html tags_
- Auto rename tag: _automatically renames html tags if you change one_

## Theming and other stuff

- Dracula: _currently my favorite color theme, I also like solarized dark_
