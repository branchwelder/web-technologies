# HTML Resources

The HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for
documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.[^wikipedia] _HTML is a
**markup language** not a **programming language**!_

Breaking down the acronym[^newcode]:

**HyperText** is simply the ability to jump from one document to another via
links.

**Markup** means that HTML specifies (marks up) content, i.e. it provides
meaning. This is a very important point. HTML is not intended to specify how
something looks; instead, it specifies what things are: a paragraph, a heading,
a quotation, etc. The appearance of content is provided by CSS).

**Language** A misnomer: HTML is not a language in the classical sense of
programming languages, because it cannot create executable programs on its own.
Do not put HTML on your resume under “Programming Languages” – any employer who
knows his code will be able to tell that you are, at best, uninformed.

## Start Here

The MDN Web docs are a fantastic resource for you as you learn web technologies.
Their
[getting started guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web)
is a great introduction to these various technologies and how they fit together.
I recommend fully reading the "Getting started" section, focusing most closely
on the following articles:

- [Dealing with files](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/Dealing_with_files) -
  to understand how files are structured
- [HTML Basics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics) -
  to get an overview of how an HTML document is structured and what tags are
  available to you
- [CSS Basics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/CSS_basics) -
  to understand how HTML can be styled
- [How the web works](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/How_the_Web_works) -
  to understand the grand scheme
