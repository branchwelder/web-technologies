# HTML Resources

The HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for
documents designed to be displayed in a web browser[^wikipedia]. _HTML is a
**markup language** not a **programming language**!_

Breaking down the acronym[^newcode]:

**HyperText** is simply the ability to jump from one document to another via
links.

**Markup** means that HTML specifies (marks up) content, i.e. it provides
meaning. This is a very important point. HTML is not intended to specify how
something looks; instead, it specifies what things are: a paragraph, a heading,
a quotation, etc. The appearance of content is provided by CSS).

**Language** A misnomer: HTML is not a language in the classical sense of
programming languages, because it cannot create executable programs on its own.
Do not put HTML on your resume under “Programming Languages” – any employer who
knows his code will be able to tell that you are, at best, uninformed.

## Start Here

Watch
[this video](https://css-tricks.com/video-screencasts/58-html-css-the-very-basics/)
to get a sense of the basics. To get a quick overview of HTML syntax, consult
[Learn X in Y Minutes (HTML)](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/html/). The MDN
Web docs are a fantastic resource for you as you learn web technologies. Their
[getting started guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web)
is a great introduction to these various technologies and how they fit together.
I recommend fully reading the "Getting started" section, focusing most closely
on the following articles:

- [Dealing with files](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/Dealing_with_files) -
  to understand how files are structured
- [HTML Basics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics) -
  to get an overview of how an HTML document is structured and what tags are
  available to you
- [CSS Basics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/CSS_basics) -
  to understand how HTML can be styled
- [How the web works](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/How_the_Web_works) -
  to understand the grand scheme

The following sections on HTML and CSS are much longer. Look at the topics
listed in the sidebar and feel free to read any articles that look interesting.
