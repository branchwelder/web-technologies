# The Document Object Model (DOM)

The Document Object Model (DOM) is the data representation of the objects that
comprise the structure and content of a document on the web.[^mdn] The DOM is an
API, not a programming language. Without it, the JavaScript language wouldn't
have any model or notion of web pages, HTML documents, SVG documents, and their
component parts. Much of the JavaScript code you will write uses the DOM API to
access the document and its elements.

When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model of the
page[^w3dom]:
