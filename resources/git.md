# Git and GitHub

**What is Git?**

Git is a distributed version control system; it is a tool that helps you manage
your source code history. You will only need to use basic git functionality for
this course, but git is an incredibly powerful tool. Some basic Git commands
are:

```
git status
git add
git commit
```

**What is GitHub?:** GitHub is a collaboration platform that uses Git for
versioning. GitHub is a popular place to share and contribute to open-source
software. Other collaboration platforms include [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/),
[Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/), and
[SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/).

**What is a repository?:** A repository is a project containing files and
folders. A repository tracks versions of files and folders.
