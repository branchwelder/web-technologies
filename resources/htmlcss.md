## Getting Started

The MDN Web docs are a fantastic resource for you as you learn web technologies.
Their
[getting started guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web)
is a great introduction to these various technologies and how they fit together.
I recommend fully reading the "Getting started" section, focusing most closely
on the following articles:

- [Dealing with files](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/Dealing_with_files) -
  to understand how files are structured
- [HTML Basics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics) -
  to get an overview of how an HTML document is structured and what tags are
  available to you
- [CSS Basics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/CSS_basics) -
  to understand how HTML can be styled
- [How the web works](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/How_the_Web_works) -
  to understand the grand scheme

The following sections on HTML and CSS are much longer. Look at the topics
listed in the sidebar and feel free to read any articles that look interesting.
The articles that are probably most useful for this mini project are:
