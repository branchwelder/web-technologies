# JSON - JavaScript Object Notation

JSON is a lightweight data interchange format. It is based on a subset of
JavaScript, but it can be used by practically any modern programming language.
As a result, it is often used to store and send information between a client and
a server. It is intended to be _human readable_, meaning that it is easy for
humans to read and write. Because of the simple standard format and wide
adoption, you will also often see configuration files (e.g. `package.json` or
`manifest.json`) written in JSON.
