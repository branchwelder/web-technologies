# CSS Resources

Knowledge of CSS comes with exposure. When learning CSS, I recommend starting by
envisioning a desired result, such as a particular layout or animation, and then
figuring out how to make it. Just reading lists of CSS rules won't be very
informative until you have a reason to use them.
