# General Resources For Web Development

- [Roundup of Web Research](https://css-tricks.com/2022-roundup-of-web-research/)
- Each year, Stack Overflow conducts a developer survey
  ([2022 survey results](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/) from 70,000
  respondents). This is good way to get a sense of which technologies are
  popular. The results are typically broken down into professional developers
  and learners.

## Code Playgrounds

Here is an
[overview comparison](https://codysaylor.com/notes/comparing-codepen-jsfiddle-cssdeck-liveweave-jsbin-dabblet/)
of different code playgrounds. Also see this
[list on wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_online_source_code_playgrounds).
CodePen and JSFiddle seem to be the most popular from my anecdotal experience.

- [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) - Is my go-to
- JSFiddle
- JSBin
- [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) - Seems promising but I haven't spent much time
  with it
- [Dabblet](https://dabblet.com/) - I wanted to like it but it was a bit
  unstable for me (on Chromium)
- [OpenProcessing](https://openprocessing.org/) - focused on creative code
- [ShaderToy](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/XsVSDz)
