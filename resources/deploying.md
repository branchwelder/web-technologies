# Deploying your website

Your portfolio is hosted on Github pages.

## Basics

- [What is a web server?](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_is_a_web_server)
- [Servers, Domain Names, and Hosting Reading List](https://thenewcode.com/1004/Web-Developer-Reading-List-Servers-Domain-Names-and-Hosting)

## Hosting Services

- [Github pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart) (for static sites)
- [Render](https://render.com/)

The big ones (in order of popularity)[^devsurvey22]

- [Amazon Web Services (AWS)]
- [Microsoft Azure]
- [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/)
- [Firebase](https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/)
- [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) - my former go-to, but their pricing has
  recently changed and it is much less intuitive than Render. I don't recommend
  learning unless you're already familiar.
