# SVG: Scalable Vector Graphics

On the web, you'll work with two types of images — raster images, and vector
images:[^mdnsvg]

- Raster images are defined using a grid of pixels — a raster image file
  contains information showing exactly where each pixel is to be placed, and
  exactly what color it should be. Popular web raster formats include Bitmap
  (.bmp), PNG (.png), JPEG (.jpg), and GIF (.gif.)
- Vector images are defined using algorithms — a vector image file contains
  shape and path definitions that the computer can use to work out what the
  image should look like when rendered on the screen. The SVG format allows us
  to create powerful vector graphics for use on the Web.
