# Syllabus

Five billion people use applications built for the web every day. These include
tools for socialization, productivity, education, recreation, and more. How can
you contribute your own tools to the ever-growing ecosystem of the world-wide
web? The overarching goal of this course is to help students become _independent
builders of web applications._ To accomplish this, the course will introduce
students to the main components of a modern web development workflow. This
includes skills such as setting up a development environment, working with
markup and scripting languages (HTML/CSS/JavaScript), harnessing browser
capabilities, and integrating external APIs and libraries using provided
documentation.

Students will develop these skills through three mini-projects and one final
project. They will document their progress on a portfolio website they build
from scratch. Their portfolio will also include reflections on their personal
development journey. Class time will consist of a mix of short lectures, live
demonstrations, in-class activities, and open project work time where
instructors are available to assist. Students are encouraged to work together to
solve technical problems. However, all assignment submissions are individual,
including the final project.

### Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

- describe the primary programming concepts and languages of the web,
- set up and use a web development environment on their personal computers, and
- independently design, implement, and deploy a client-side web application.

### Course Schedule

We will broadly follow the following topics each week. Keep in mind that this
schedule is flexible and subject to change.

1. Intro: What is a "web technology", anyway? _MP0: A static portfolio site on
   Github pages._
2. The DOM: How do these "web technologies" fit together? _MP1: A browser
   extension._
3. Development Strategies: Where do I go when I need to solve problems on my
   own? _MP1: A browser extension._
4. Browser APIS: What can a browser do? _MP2: An audio visualizer._
5. Libraries and Frameworks: What the heck is React (and why aren't we learning
   it)? _MP2: An audio visualizer._
6. Interactivity: What is state (and when do we need it)? _MP3: A game._
7. Mobile: When should we care about phones? _MP3: A game._ (Hannah gone 2/14)
8. The Full Stack: When do I need a backend (and how do I integrate one)? _Final
   Project: Proposal_
9. Special topics: TBD? _Final Project: First iteration_
10. Where do you go from here? _Final project demonstrations_
11. Finals week. _Portfolio site submission._

### Assignments

This is a project-based course. In the first week of the course, students will
set up a portfolio website. Throughout the course, they will keep their
portfolio site updated with subsequent work, and use it as a place to practice
concepts introduced in class. All projects completed in the course should be
hosted and accessible publicly. If they would like to turn this site into their
public portfolio, students are encouraged to include additional content (e.g.
project pages for projects from other courses). At final submission, the
portfolio website should (at minimum) contain the following sub-pages:

**Four** mini-project pages:

- MP0: Portfolio site setup
- MP1: Browser Extension
- MP2: Audio Visualizer
- MP3: Game

**Three** final project pages:

- Proposal: design goals and implementation plan
- MVP: a _simple yet functional_ version
- Final version

**Three** development reflections:

- A cheatsheet: tips and tricks for future reference. This is primarily for your
  own use, but I hope to compile them into a class-wide cheatsheet.
- _Two_ hair-tear-shares (HTS): Writeups documenting specific problems (e.g. CSS
  bugs, documentation frustration) students encountered and describing the steps
  they took to overcome them. These will also be presented in class.

### Communication

Communication for this course will primarily take place on Discord. We will also
communicate via email for important or time-sensitive announcements (e.g. class
session cancellation due to weather). **Do not message the instructors on
Canvas**.

Students are expected to ask technical questions in the appropriate Discord
channels (e.g. #debugging, #apis, etc.). **The instructors will not respond to
any private messages regarding technical questions and will instead repost them
in the appropriate Discord channel.** Chances are, one of your peers will have
encountered the problem you are trying to solve and can share their experiences.
Posting your questions publicly will give you and your peers practice asking and
responding to technical questions. Questions regarding personal circumstances
(assignment extensions, illness, etc.) should be sent over private message or
email.

### Class Meetings and Office Hours

**This course is taught in person**. Attendance at all sessions is expected. The
instructors are happy to schedule additional office hours by request for
students who attend course sessions, bar exceptional circumstances (e.g.
illness). See the Canvas page for course meeting times and office hours
schedule.

### Grading

The grading breakdown is as follows:

- Portfolio site: 10%
- Hair tear shares: 10%
- Mini Projects: 40%
- Final Project: 30%
- Peer teaching: 10%

Students are allowed and encouraged to work together to solve various technical,
programming, and design problems. In the studio model for courses like this,
sharing knowledge and strategies is part of the process, and you will learn an
enormous amount from each other; hence peer teaching being 10% of your grade.

In general, submitting late work is penalized 10% of its total grade per
calendar day. This is to encourage you to keep up with the work and to be fair
to all students. If there are legitimate extenuating circumstances for why you
will be late submitting an assignment, at our discretion we will try to
accommodate your needs. The earlier you notify us, the more likely you are to be
granted an extension.

### Policies

UW policies (e.g. regarding academic integrity, participation, and religious or
disability accomodations) apply to this course. Unless you notify us otherwise,
we assume that you are willing to allow us to use samples from your work in this
course in future instructional settings (e.g., excerpts or examples in
presentations). Similarly, unless you notify us otherwise, we assume that you
are willing to allow us to use photographs of you taken in class sessions for
department and university promotional and publicity purposes (e.g. brochures,
flyers, websites, etc.).

This syllabus and all associated assignments, requirements, deadlines, and
procedures are subject to change. We will try to warn you well in advance of any
changes to deadlines.
