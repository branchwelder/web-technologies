# Syllabus

Five billion people use applications built for the web every day. These
applications are tools for socialization, productivity, education, recreation,
and more. How can you contribute your own tools to the ever-growing ecosystem of
the world-wide web? The overarching goal of this course is to help students
become _independent builders of web applications._ To accomplish this, the
course will introduce students to the main components of a modern web
development workflow. This includes skills such as setting up a development
environment, working with markup and scripting languages (HTML/CSS/JavaScript),
harnessing browser capabilities, and integrating external APIs and libraries
using provided documentation.

Students will develop these skills through three mini-projects and one final
project. They will document their progress on a portfolio website they (of
course) build from scratch. Their portfolio will also include reflections on
their personal development journey. Class time will consist of a mix of short
lectures, live demonstrations, in-class activities, and open project work time
where instructors are available to assist. Students will work in small groups,
pairs, or solo for in-class activities. Students will work independently on all
homework assignments, including the final project.

### Learning outcomes

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

- describe the primary programming concepts and languages of the web,
- set up and use a web development environment on their personal computers, and
- independently design, implement, and deploy a client-side web application.

### Course Schedule

We will broadly follow the following topics each week. Keep in mind that this
schedule is flexible and subject to change.

1. Intro: What is a "web technology", anyway? _MP0: A static portfolio site on
   Github pages._
2. The DOM: How do these "web technologies" fit together? _MP1: A browser
   extension._
3. Development Strategies: Where do I go when I need to solve problems on my
   own? _MP1: A browser extension._
4. Browser APIS: What can a browser do? _MP2: An audio visualizer._
5. Libraries and Frameworks: What the heck is React (and why aren't we learning
   it)? _MP2: An audio visualizer._
6. Interactivity: What is state (and when do we need it)? _MP3: A game._
7. Mobile: When should we care about phones? _MP3: A game._ (Hannah gone 2/14)
8. The Full Stack: When do I need a backend (and how do I integrate one)? _Final
   Project: Proposal_
9. Special topics: TBD? _Final Project: First iteration_
10. Where do you go from here? _Final project demonstrations_
11. Finals week. _Portfolio site submission._

### Assignments

This is a project-based course. In the first week of the course, students will
set up a portfolio website, which they will keep updated with subsequent work.
All projects completed in the course should be hosted publicly and usable by
anyone with a laptop (or phone, depending on the project) and an internet
connection. At the end of the course, the portfolio website should contain the
following sub-pages:

**Four** mini-project pages:

- MP0: The portfolio site
- MP1: Browser Extension
- MP2: Audio Visualizer
- MP3: Game

**Three** final project pages:

- Proposal: design goals and implementation plan
- MVP: a _simple yet functional_ version
- Final version:

**Three** development reflections:

- A cheatsheet: tips and tricks for future reference. This is primarily for your
  own use, but I hope to compile them into a class-wide cheatsheet.
- _Two_ hair-tear-shares (HTS): Writeups documenting specific problems (e.g. CSS
  bugs, documentation frustration) students encountered and describing the steps
  they took to overcome them. These will also be presented in class.

### Communication

Communication for this course will primarily take place on Discord. We will also
communicate via email for important or time-sensitive announcements (e.g. class
session cancellation due to weather). **Do not message the instructors on
Canvas**.

Students are expected to ask technical questions in the appropriate Discord
channels (e.g. #debugging, #apis, etc.). **The instructors will not respond to
any private messages regarding technical questions and will instead repost them
in the appropriate Discord channel.** Chances are, one of your peers will have
encountered the problem you are trying to solve and can share their experiences.
Posting your questions publicly will give you and your peers practice asking and
responding to technical questions. Questions regarding personal circumstances
(assignment extensions, illness, etc.) should be sent over private message or
email.

### Contact Information

- **Hannah Twigg-Smith (Instructor)**
- **Raina Langevin (TA)**

### Class Meetings

**This course is taught in person**. Attendance at all sessions is expected. The
instructors are happy to schedule additional office hours by request for
students who attend course sessions, bar exceptional circumstances (e.g.
illness).

Course sessions:

- Tuesdays and Thursdays 12:30 - 2:50 PM (SIEG 233)

Office hours:

- Hannah: Wednesdays 10AM - 12PM (SIEG 128)
- Raina: (TBD)

### Grading

The approximate grading breakdown is as follows:

- Portfolio site: 15%
- Mini Projects: 30%
- Development reflections: 15%
- Final Project: 40%
- Participation (modifier): (+-5%)

Students are allowed and encouraged to work together to solve various technical,
programming, and design problems. In the studio model for courses like this,
sharing knowledge and strategies is part of the process, and you will learn an
enormous amount from each other.

In general, submitting late work is penalized 10% of its total grade per
calendar day. This is to encourage you to keep up with the work and to be fair
to all students. If there are legitimate extenuating circumstances for why you
will be late submitting an assignment, at our discretion we will try to
accommodate your needs. The earlier you notify us, the more likely you are to be
granted an extension.

### Policies

UW policies (e.g. regarding academic integrity, participation, and religious or
disability accomodations) apply to this course. Unless you notify us otherwise,
we assume that you are willing to allow us to use samples from your work in this
course in future instructional settings (e.g., excerpts or examples in
presentations). Similarly, unless you notify us otherwise, we assume that you
are willing to allow us to use photographs of you taken in class sessions for
department and university promotional and publicity purposes (e.g., brochures,
flyers, websites, etc.).

This syllabus and all associated assignments, requirements, deadlines, and
procedures are subject to change. We will try to warn you well in advance of any
changes to deadlines.
