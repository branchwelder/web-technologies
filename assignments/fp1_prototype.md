# Final Project Prototype

For this assignment, you will create a quick iteration of your final project. We
are making the prototype a separate requirement in order to help you scaffold
your final project work. Your prototype should be a **functional** minimal
implementation of your final project, which is deployed and available online.

You should submit a link to a project writeup that will go on your website. This
writeup should follow the [writeup guidelines](/assignments/writeups.md).

**Important:** I want you to create **separate** git repositories for your
prototype and final version. If you are building off of/improving a mini
project, you should still create the prototype/final version repos as well, and
copy over your files. This is so we have a snapshot of your intermediate
version.

I've made a [template project](https://github.com/branchwelder/webdev-template)
with a basic development toolchain setup which you can use if you would like.
Instructions are in the repo.

## Additional requirements

In addition to following the normal
[writeup guidelines](/assignments/writeups.md) for this writeup, please also
include answers to the following questions:

- **Project scope:** How has your project scope changed now that you have
  completed your prototype? What features have been added/removed to/from your
  anticipated final project?
- **Time management:** How did the amount of time you spent building your
  prototype compare to your initial plan? Were there any unanticipated
  roadblocks or setbacks?
- **Implementation plan:** How has your implementation plan for your final
  version changed now that you have completed your prototype? Why has it
  changed?

## Submission

Submit a link to your prototype writeup in Canvas. Ensure that you include links
to your prototype git repo and the deployed version of the prototype.
