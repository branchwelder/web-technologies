# Final Portfolio

If you have been keeping up with the class content (projects and in-class
activities), your final portfolio will be complete by the end of the quarter and
this submission should not require much additional work.

## Requirements

These are the requirements for the final submission:

**Available publicly.** Anyone should be able to access your site via the base
URL. For most of you, this will be `username.github.io`. Additionally, your
site's Github repository must be public.

**Content.** Your site should include all of the work produced for this class,
which is listed below. Additionally, all subpages must be accessible by
navigating from the home page. In other words, we should not have to type in a
URL to access any of your subpages. Beyond this requirement, how you organize
your site is up to you - for example, your home page could have a "writeups"
button that links to a subpage containing links to all your writeups.

- Home page
- Bio/About page
- Cheatsheets page
- Four Mini-project writeups (MP0: Setup, MP1: Extension, MP2: Creative Code,
  MP3: Game)
- Your MP2 sketch gallery,
- All of your sketches from MP2
- Your MP3 Game
- Three final project writeups (Proposal, MVP, Final)
- Your final project

**Design.** The aesthetics of your site are largely up to you, and we encourage
you to explore fun and creative site layouts. Start with
[this helpful guide](https://jgthms.com/web-design-in-4-minutes/). However, we
do have a few requirements for your site's final design:

- **Responsive layout.** Your site layout should be responsive to the size of
  the window. This means that your site should render nicely on both a phone and
  a computer. For example, a vertical sidebar might work well if someone views
  your site on a laptop, but it will likely render incorrectly on a phone by
  default.
- **Custom styling.** Your site should include non-default styling. At a bare
  minumum you should specify custom colors and fonts (while ensuring appropriate
  foreground/background contrast), and add your own styles to HTML elements such
  as buttons or input. We will not be grading you on how "nice" your site looks,
  as that is very subjective - but we would like you to be proud to show your
  site to your peers!
- **Add a favicon.** You can use a tool like [favicon.io](https://favicon.io/)
  to create a favicon for your site.

**Accessibility.** Your site should follow the
[Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-WCAG20-20081211/):
perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust. Here is a
[helpful blog post](https://www.mightybytes.com/blog/web-content-accessibility-guidelines/)
describing ways to make your sites more accessible. At a minimum:

- **Include alt text.** All images and links on your site should include alt
  text.
- **Appropriate colors and contrast.** Colors should be accessible, and you
  should not rely on color to convey meaning. Also - foreground and background
  color contrast should be high enough. You can check contrast with a tool like
  [this](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/).
- **Keyboard navigation.** Someone should be able to navigate your site via
  keyboard, e.g. using tab and enter.

**Strongly Encouraged: Browser compatibility.** Finally, you should try to
ensure your site works across the three main browsers: Chrome, Firefox, and
Safari, on both desktop and mobile. We understand that it might be difficult to
robustly support each platform (e.g. if you have a Windows laptop/Android phone
and cannot install Safari), so you will not lose points for this criteria.
However, you should make a decent effort to ensure compatibility across
browsers. You will want to do this anyway if you are planning on using this site
as your personal portfolio.

## Going Beyond

We encourage you to use this site as your personal portfolio, and we hope that
the submission guidelines are flexible enough that it will be easy to do so.
Here are some ideas on how you could continue to improve your site beyond the
class:

- **Buy a custom domain name.** It is easy to connect a custom domain to Github
  pages, and sites such as GoDaddy and Namecheap have domains for as little as
  $1 a year. Bonus: once you own a domain, you can use it in your email address!
- **Integrate a static site generator.** Static site generators such as Hugo or
  Gatsby are great for building sites that include more content. We did not
  cover them in this class, but if you are going to use this site in the future
  and would like to add content such as a blog, these are the way to go!
