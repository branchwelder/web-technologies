# MP1: A Browser Extension

You've played around a bit with HTML and CSS, and we've written a bit of
JavaScript. Now it's time to apply what you've learned to make your first tool.

## Getting Started

Learn a bit about JavaScript:

- Read JavaScript.info's fundamentals chapter
  [https://javascript.info/first-steps]

Learn about how you can use JavaScript to manipulate the DOM

- Read javascript.info's [chapter on the DOM](https://javascript.info/document)
- Read
  [this article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs/Manipulating_documents)
  on manipulating the DOM.
- [Chrome Extensions 101](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/extensions-101/)
- [Chrome Extensions development basics](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/development-basics/)
- [Extension development overview](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/devguide/)

## Instructions

I've created a number of example extensions to help you get started. To get
started, clone
[my `extension-toolkit` repository](https://github.com/branchwelder/extension-toolkit).

- Load the unpacked extension in your browser (instructions
  [here](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/development-basics/#load-unpacked))

- Create an icon! You can design one yourself, or use a site such as
  [favicon.io](https://favicon.io/)

## What to turn in

A writeup that includes the following:

- Screenshots of your development process
- Description of a technical problem you ran into and the steps you took to
  resolve it
- Bullet points with your future work

## Going Further

<!-- - Add an
  [options page](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/options/) -->

- I _strongly_ encourage you to publish your extension to the Chrome Web Store
  following
  [the documentation](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/webstore/publish/). This
  is not required, as you will need to pay a $5 one-time fee to register as a
  developer.
