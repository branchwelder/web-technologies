# MP1: A Browser Extension

You've played around a bit with HTML and CSS, and we've written a bit of
JavaScript. Now it's time to apply what you've learned to build your first tool:
a browser extension. This assignment is designed to help you get familiar with
JavaScript and how to use it to interact with and manipulate the DOM API.

## Background Reading

Learn a bit about JavaScript:

- Work through the MDN Docs
  [JavaScript articles](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript)
- Read JavaScript.info's
  [fundamentals chapter](https://javascript.info/first-steps)

<!-- - MDN docs
  [article on functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Functions) -->

Learn about how you can use JavaScript to manipulate the DOM

- Read javascript.info's [chapter on the DOM](https://javascript.info/document)
- Read
  [this article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs/Manipulating_documents)
  on manipulating the DOM.

Different kinds of events:

- MDN
  [Introduction to events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Events)

Learn about developing a browser extension from Chrome's documentation:

- [Chrome Extensions 101](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/extensions-101/)
- [Chrome Extensions development basics](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/development-basics/)
- [Extension development overview](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/devguide/)

## Instructions

To get started, clone my
[extension toolkit repository](https://github.com/branchwelder/extension-toolkit).
This repository contains a number of example extensions that I created to
demonstrate some of the core features an extension might contain.

- Load the unpacked extension in your browser (instructions
  [here](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/development-basics/#load-unpacked))

- Make an icon for your extension! You can design one yourself, or use a site
  such as [favicon.io](https://favicon.io/)

## What to turn in

A writeup that includes the following:

- Screenshots of your development process
- Description of a technical problem you ran into and the steps you took to
  resolve it
- Bullet points with your future work

## Going Further

- **Publish your extension:** I _strongly_ encourage you to publish your
  extension to the Chrome Web Store following
  [their documentation](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/webstore/publish/).
  This is not required, as you will need to pay a $5 one-time fee to register as
  a developer.
- **Support additional browsers:** You can explore supporting additional
  browsers (e.g. Safari and Firefox). MDN has instructions on how to do this
  [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Build_a_cross_browser_extension).
