# Writeup Guidelines

These are the general guidelines for your project writeups. Each writeup should
be publicly accessible on your portfolio website. A writeup should include the
following sections:

- **Overview and Usage:** Describe your project's core functionality and include
  a gif of it in action. Include instructions on how to run your code, or a link
  if it is hosted online.
- **Development Process:** Summarize the main steps you carried out during
  development, including in-progress screenshots.
- **Issue Deep-Dive:** Description of an issue you ran into, and the steps you
  took to resolve it
- **Ideas and Future Work:** Ideas for what features you might like to add to
  your project in the future (can be bullet points)
- **Kudos:** Links to any particularly useful resources you found during your
  project. You should also credit any classmates or friends who helped you.

More detailed guidelines below.

## Overview and Usage

Your overview should be a short description describing your project's core
functionality. You should include at least one gif of your project in action.
This section should also include instructions for running your code. For most
projects in this class, you can just include a link to the hosted site.

## Development Process

A step-by-step overview of your process for this project, **with at least one
screenshot of an unfinished state**. For example, you might separate the work
you did for MP0 into:

- Cloning the example and running it locally
- Desiging a custom site layout
- Adding custom styles
- Adding sub-pages

## Issue Deep-Dive

Describe an issue you encountered and how you resolved it. For example, you
might have had trouble pushing your site to Github, or a confusing syntax issue
with HTML.

First, describe the problem you encountered, for example:

- **Syntax errors:** These are spelling or punctuation errors in your code that
  actually cause the program not to run. These are usually easy to fix as long
  as you are familiar with the language's syntax and know what the error
  messages mean.
- **Logic errors:** These are errors where the syntax is actually correct, but
  the code is not what you intended it to be, meaning that the program runs
  incorrectly. These are often harder to fix than syntax errors, as there isn't
  an error message to direct you to the source of the error.

Second, describe how you resolved it and what you learned along the way, for
example:

- Using the your browser's developer tools, such as the DOM inspector
- Interpreting error messages
- Running your HTML page through the Markup Validation Service
- Checking if the CSS property and value youâ€™re using are supported by the
  browser you are testing in
- Checking if something more specific is overriding your CSS
- Make a reduced test case of the problem - copy your code to a code sharing
  site like CodePen and remove components until you get down to the smallest
  amount of code that still shows the issue.

## Ideas and Future Work

Bullet points describing additional ideas and features you might like to add to
your site in the future. You can optionally include more detail in this section,
such as ideas for how you might implement one of your ideas. For example, you
might have the following list for MP0:

- Purchase and connect a custom domain!
- Add additional sub-pages for prior projects you have done!
- Add a button to switch between light and dark mode!
- Make it look really nice! More CSS beyond the basics.
- Make it mobile-friendly!

## Kudos

In the kudos section, you should list any online resources that were
particularly helpful while you were doing your development. In particular, if
you copy any code you should list your source here. Please also give kudos to
any classmates or friends who helped you.
