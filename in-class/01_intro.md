# Introduction: Setting up a development environment

Today in class, set up your devlopment environment! This is often the first
major hurdle you will have to overcome as a developer. The instructors will be
around to answer questions and help as needed.

## Discord

Make a [Discord](https://discord.com/) account and join the class Discord. The
invite link is on the Canvas page (not posted here because this is a public
repository). I _highly recommend_ installing Discord onto both your phone and
personal laptop and not relying on the web interface. Communication over Discord
will be very important for this course, and it would be best to get timely
notifications. However, I realize everyone has their own preferences regarding
asynchronous communication.

**Important: Once you have joined the class Discord, set your display name to
the name you want us to use in class!**

## Github Desktop

[Make a Github account](https://github.com/) and
[install Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/).

## VS Code

In this course, we will be using Visual Studio Code (generally shortened to VS
Code). At its core, VS Code is a _highly extensible_ text editor. This means
that its base function is quite simple: you can open and edit files. The best
part of VS Code is the extension marketplace, which lets you add bits of
functionality as you need them, such as support for different languages. You can
even write your own VS Code extensions using the technologies you will learn in
this class! Note that VS Code is NOT the same as Visual Studio, which is a
full-featured IDE that is (in my opinion) overkill for most web development
workflows. VS Code is by

[Download and install Visual Studio Code.](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

If you have a different editor preference (e.g. Sublime), you are welcome to use
it. However, we will mainly be supporting VS Code and many assignments will rely
on some of its built-in functionality.

Sign in with your Github account.

Once you have VS Code up and running, install the following three extensions
from the extension store:

- [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)
- [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)
- [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)

Now, do a bit of customization! I hope all of you will become die-hard fans of a
particular editor color scheme. There are many VS Code themes available. For
fun, peruse a few (you can do this by clicking the "filter" button and choosing
`Category > Themes`) and install one, such as:

- [Dracula](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dracula-theme.theme-dracula) -
  _my long-time favorite_
- [Monokai Pro](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=monokai.theme-monokai-pro-vscode) -
  _a nice-looking option_
- Solarized Dark - _built into VS Code, used to be my previous go-to_
- [Nord](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=arcticicestudio.nord-visual-studio-code) -
  _Too low-contrast for me, but I use it for other applications_
- [Gruvbox](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jdinhlife.gruvbox) -
  _A fun retro feel_

There are many, many extensions out there, and you are free to explore them at
your leisure. However, don't go overboard! I've previously run into issues where
I don't remember (or use) extensions I've installed, which can lead to
unexpected behavior and longer VS Code load times. I recommend just installing
the few I have mentioned to start. Add only one at a time, only add ones you
need, and uninstall any you do not use. If you're interested, I have compiled a
(perhaps outdated) list of the extensions I use
[here](/resources/vscode_extensions.md).
