# Final Project Proposal

You will create a **functional** prototype of your project in the first week. It
is **expected** that this will be an _extremely_ minimal version of your final
project. This is to encourage you to scope your development work appropriately.
It is very easy to go overboard when coming up with ideas for future features to
implement. I have found that when working on projects by myself, I get excited
about all of the ideas I have for where a project could go. However, if you try
to implement them all at once, it is easy to get overwhelmed and frustrated that
the idea in your head is not

## Project Options

There are few restrictions on what you could do for your final project. I want
to give you space to explore your own interests. That said, here are a few
ideas:

- Revisit a mini project and make it better
- Incorporate a backend, such as the app you made for HCDE 310
- Explore React Native to create a mobile app
- Use Electron to create a desktop app

## Submission Requirements

For the project proposal, you will create a sub-page on your portfolio website
that includes the following sections:

- A brief description of your project idea
  - A description of the project you want to demo on demo day.
  - A description of a minimal version.
  - A description of an (even more) minimal version.
- A step-by-step plan-of-attack.
- A bulleted list of known unknowns (things you don't currently know how to do,
  but know you will have to figure out), and ideas
- A bulleted list of stretch goals.

<!-- # Final Project

There are very few restrictions on what to do for your final project.

Here are some example paths that I think would be a good fit given the topics
covered in this course:

- Write a VS Code extension
- Revisit one of the three mini projects and make a more refined version
- Add a module to Planager, Hannah's research project!
- Something completely different!

## Things we haven't covered

- WebXR Device API -->
