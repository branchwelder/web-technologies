# Logistics

## Plan for today

- Checking in
- Turning in MP1
- Scope and async/await
- Work time!

## Checking in

- What's up?
- Questions in Discord?
- Attendance at office hours?

Check-in survey: https://forms.gle/4P5cVzejdHEeiNco6

## Turning in MP1

The writeup should be on your portfolio page, like MP0! Remember:

- In-progress screenshots
- A gif of your extension in action
- Include Kudos to fellow classmates and online resources

. . .

_I encourage you to publish your extension on the Chrome Web store_

# JavaScript concepts: Scope

## Scope

If a variable is defined inside a code block (curly braces: `{...}`), it will
only be visible inside that block.

```js
{
  // do some job with local variables that should not be seen outside
  let message = "Hello"; // only visible in this block
  alert(message); // Hello
}

alert(message);
```

. . .

What do you think will happen?

## Scope

This rule holds for variables defined inside loops and conditionals:

```js
if (true) {
  let phrase = "Hello!";

  alert(phrase);
}

alert(phrase);
```

. . .

What do you think will happen?

## Scope

```js
if (true) {
  let x = 1;
}

console.log(x);
```

. . .

# JavaScript Concepts: Async/await

## Async/Await

- Many tasks you might want to do in your code will take time to complete
- However, JavaScript does not wait for code to complete by default!
- This is because we do not want our applications to become unresponsive

## Synchronous code

```js
console.log(" I ");

console.log(" eat ");

console.log(" Ice Cream ");
```

## Asynchronous code

```js
console.log("I");

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("eat");
}, 2000);

console.log("Ice Cream");
```

. . .

What do you think will happen?

## Example

- We can use async/await to write our code so it looks like it is syncronous

Example: background-colorizer extension
